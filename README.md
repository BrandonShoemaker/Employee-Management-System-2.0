## Description

In this project you will be prompted to choose between viewing, adding, and updating various parts of a database through an inquirer thread. You may view all departments, roles, and employees in the system. You may add a department, role, and employee. You may update the role of a specific employee. All functions are very self explanatory. Many challenges were faced in this project, such as learning that inquirer and servers run on different levels and have no knowledge of each others paths, such as inquirer using a fetch request not having access to any localhost routes unless explicitly stated as a full url. As well as fighting with the asyncronicity of database.query calls.
